-- random ideas --

* IMC (intermud communication): both channels *and* noteboards
  (perhaps separate server for noteboard, or whatever)
* slashdot-like moderation system on noteboards

-- not really code specific, but still open issues: --

* general format for docs (docwrite-HOWTO something), both
  for HTML and plaintext docs
* general coding guidelines
