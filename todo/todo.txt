* add some checks to do_give, do_get, do_drop with respect to inter-align trading,
  ROOM_NODROP etc.
* implement support for various EX_*, ROOM_*, SECT_* flags, most notably:
		ROOM_NOFLOOR, EX_NOBREAK, EX_SWIM etc.
* better damage/xp system (more balanced)
* Better online construction (autocreate exit+room when moving),
  mobile create/edit, reset edit etc.
- some form of classes/professions/guilds/religions/whatever
	-> probably Schools	
- more help text
- skills: Disarm, Steal, Lockpick, Hide
- reloadarea command
- race specifics
  -> add field to race format for racial abilities like Infravision etc.
- bugtrack/report system 
- modularized mud, pluggable objects (like timers, sets of commands, etc.)
- spells: Mistform (walk thru doors, ethereal bla)
- "real life" sleep - players need sleep to keep from falling down after 2 days,
  some rooms (with beds) have better sleep ratios etc.
- expand tracking system
- when rapier in inv and rapier in eq, make 2.rapier match the one in eq
- implement isPlayerName(), isObjectName(), isMobName() and (perhaps)
  isSpellName() and enforce their use throughout the code
- have mudstatus save when shutting down (mudstatus defined as: mudtime, weather(?), etc.)


l implementation of the mud sound protocol
l new area format using XML
l purge command (strips char of objects, only for admins)
l clan competition for wps/pkillnum
l channel history, for gt/ct/chat/raid
l abbreviation of clanname (3-4 chars) in who list
l mud police!
l online suggest (pray) history
l mobprog compiling to some sort of pseudo stack machine code
l fully customizable mud - experience formulas, experience per level, 
	damage formulas, number of stats, stat maximums, health/mana/movement maximums
l bodypart damage/armor ?


-- random ideas --

* IMC (intermud communication): both channels *and* noteboards
  (perhaps separate server for noteboard, or whatever)
* slashdot-like moderation system on noteboards

-- not really code specific, but still open issues: --

* general format for docs (docwrite-HOWTO something), both
  for HTML and plaintext docs
* general coding guidelines
