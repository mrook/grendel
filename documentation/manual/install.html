<p><b>1. Downloading</b><br>
Every Grendel release comes in a Win32 .zip file, which can easily be opened and extracted
using <a href="http://www.winzip.com/" target="_blank">WinZIP</a>.
</p>
<p><b>2. Compiling</b><br>
The full distributions come with a prebuilt executable, so if this is the case,
skip to part 3.
Within the Grendel root directory there is a makefile called 'makefile.w32'.
You can compile the sources by typing 'make -f makefile.w32',
which starts the Delphi command-line compiler (dcc32.exe) and compiles all executables.
</p>
<p><b>3. Running</b><br>
Switch to the directory where Grendel is located and start 'grendel.exe'. The server
starts, loads and if all goes well, enters the game loop and listens for connections
on port 4444.</p>
<p><b>4. Connecting</b><br>
Use a simple TELNET client, such as the standard telnet.exe which comes with Windows.
Some other (good) clients are: NetTerm, Ewan, WinTin, zMUD and more.
Create a new character and go have fun!</p>
<p><b>5. Closing</b><br>
Grendel can either be shutdown by an Immortal or killed from the console.</p>
