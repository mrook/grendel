Welcome to the official documentation of The Grendel Project.
These pages will tell you everything you need to know about
installing, setting up, running and maintaining Grendel.</p>
<p>It is <b>NOT</b> guaranteed that this documentation is still valid in
later versions of the software. It probably isn't valid
for earlier versions either.</p>
<p>This documentation is NOT perfect: not all things are in it, neither
are all things correct :-). If you have questions, call me or mail me and
I will put it in this documentation or rectify my errors.</p>
<p>I think you will have fun learning Grendel, learning its structure, its
behaviour. The greatest fun I had was when I completed a nice area with
good mobiles and objects and let people run through it. I hope you can
share that joy. Running a mud certainly can be a pain in the ass, but
believe me, coding one is FAR worse! :).</p>
