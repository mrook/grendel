#KEYWORD=M_DESTROY_
Your body stiffens as you hear a horrible sound... from the lurking
depths of hell, a hideous, vicious demon appears, engulfing you with
the sickening smell of death and decay!

The beast approaches you, looking at you with eyes of pure evil...
you fall to your knees, begging for mercy, begging for an escape from
your destiny...

With a chilling roar, the demon leaps towards you and extends a shredding
claw in your direction!

Before you collapse to the ground, you feel the blood spilling out of 
your ruptured organs...

You have been destroyed.

#KEYWORD=M_IMMORTALIZE_
As if you feel very tired, your eyelids slowly close...

You feel yourself floating, leaving the body that once belonged to you...
You rise up into the air, heading for the heavens...

You hear beautiful voices sing, long forgotten words come as clear as
crystal... more voices join and form an unreal chorus...

You are enveloped by a swirling vortex of colors, moving faster and
faster... Your soul becomes pure and whole...

You feel yourself losing touch with reality...

Before you drown in the ever increasing stream of new emotions, you
hear a voice whisper...

'Welcome...'

 Michael Curran  - the player title collection and additional locations.
 Bill Wisner     - for being the first to successfully port the game,
                   uncovering several old bugs, uh, inconsistencies,
                   in the process.

         And: Mads Haar and Stephan Dahl for additional locations.

  The Original DIKUMud was Developed at the Department of Computer Science
                     at the University of Copenhagen.
